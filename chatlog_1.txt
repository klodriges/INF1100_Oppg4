Implementing gc_free Function

user
The gc_free function is not made yet, I need you to fill it in.

I will review the uploaded files to understand how to implement the `gc_free` function appropriately. Let's start by examining `gc.c` and `gc.h` as these seem to be the most relevant for the `gc_free` function implementation.

The `gc.c` file provides the following details about the garbage collector implementation:

- `gc_malloc(size_t size)`: Allocates memory with an additional `sizeof(int)` to store a reference count.
- `gc_register(void *address)`: Increments the reference count for a given memory address.
- The `gc_free(void *address)` function is declared but not implemented.

### The `gc_free` Implementation Strategy
The `gc_free` function should:
1. Decrement the reference count stored at the memory location.
2. Check if the reference count has reached zero.
3. If the count is zero, free the allocated memory; otherwise, leave it as it is.

I'll implement `gc_free` based on this logic. Here is the updated code:

```c
// Unregisters use of the memory pointed to by ptr. If the reference counter is
// zero at this point the memory can be safely freed, otherwise, it must be kept intact. 
void gc_free(void *address) {
    if (address == NULL) {
        return; // No action needed for NULL pointers
    }

    // Move the address pointer back to access the reference count
    int *reference_count = (int *)(address - sizeof(int));

    assert(*reference_count > 0);

    // Decrement the reference count
    (*reference_count)--;

    // If the reference count reaches zero, free the allocated memory
    if (*reference_count == 0) {
        free(reference_count);
    }
}
```

This implementation handles the decrementing of the reference count and ensures that the memory is freed when it reaches zero. You can insert this code into your `gc.c` file where `gc_free` is defined. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or explanations!
